# react-portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my React portfolio! I have developed this portfolio to showcase my front-end web development skills and projects. Using React, I've created a polished and professional site with a mobile-first design, offering easy navigation and accessibility. The color palette is carefully chosen, ensuring readability and a visually appealing look.

    Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from https://nodejs.org/.

2. Generate a starter React app using Vite:

3. Install Bootstrap:
    Run npm i --save bootstrap @popperjs/core in your command line to install Bootstrap and Popper.js.
    Add import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'; and import * as bootstrap from 'bootstrap' to the main.jsx file.
